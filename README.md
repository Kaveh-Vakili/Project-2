# Project-2
This project is a hangman(word guessing) game. Where the computer randomly picks a word, and the user must guess what that word is. I began this project by creating a list of words that are encrypted that I wanted to use. Then I began using the randit function in order to randomly select a word from the list. I also incorporated the .lower function for when I input letters, it will be read as lowercase. I gave 20 attempts for the user to pick a word. If the word is not picked, it will print out a you lose message. Using a for loop to iterate over each index to see if the guessed letter matches the letter, will then print out the letter to the screen. If not then it will ask the user to enter a different letter instead.
